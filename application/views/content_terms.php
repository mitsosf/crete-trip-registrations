            <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
            <p>The Crete Trip 2017 by ESN Greece</p>
            <p>11/05/2017 – 14/05/2017</p>
            <p>I hereby agree that ESN Greece does not assume any responsibility whatsoever for any damage that a
                participant of a trip or activity arranged by ESN may cause to either the ESN or any third parties (i.e.
                travel companies, boats, hostels, hotels etc.). Every entity, including ESN Greece, has the right to
                seek
                reparation for any damage that a participant may cause.</p>
            <p>I also understand and accept that neither ESN Greece, nor the sponsors, university officials, volunteers
                or
                anyone involved or affiliated with the event in any way, can be held responsible for any injuries, death
                or
                other damage that may occur to a participant or his/her heirs, or related to his/her people or entities,
                as
                a result of the participant’s participation in the trip/excursion or as a result of either active or
                passive
                negligence of any person.</p>
            <p>I understand that the Organizing Committee reserves the right to amend or modify any part of the event
                content or/and schedule if necessary, at any time.</p>
            <p>I shall respect the transport schedule established by the organisers, including departure times and bus
                assignments. The OC is not responsible for any participant’s transport and accommodation beyond the
                official
                programme, either before or after the announced event dates.</p>
            <p>I also agree that I am not entitled to any refund from pre-paid activities included in the event fee,
                once
                payment has been made.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I take full responsibility if I decide not to travel with or use any pre-booked
                transportation
                (bus or ferry). If a participant fails to attend any pre-paid activity or misses any pre-booked
                transportation, no refund or compensation will be paid by ESN or anyone else. In the event of an
                accident
                requiring additional professional care, such as an ambulance or hospital, you must contact your ESN
                group
                leaders for further instructions.</p>
            <p>ESN Greece has my full consent to store my personal data submitted through the event registration form,
                to
                give every participant access to systems that show their registration process and offer advanced rooming
                capabilities. ESN Greece will NOT share any of your personal data with external sources or use any of
                the
                data acquired from the registration form for advertising purposes.</p>
            <p>Finally, I hereby give full rights to ESN Greece to use my image in films, videos, photographs and any
                further elaborated form of the previous as well as my name and my voice, for the purposes of promotion,
                advertising, training manuals and volunteering in every part of the world in any medium and in any time,
                without any restrictions.</p>
            <p> Remember, you are responsible for your actions!</p>
            <p><h4>All formalities aside and most importantly...</h4>
            <h3>ENJOY The Crete Trip!!!</h3> </p>
