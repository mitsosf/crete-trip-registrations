# crete-trip-registrations

A PHP, HTML, CSS, MySQL project utilising the CodeIgniter framework.

Built for the Erasmus Student Network in Greece, as a way to better manage the network's national event, The Crete Trip.
This version was deployed during last year's event, with absolute success, managing over 1000 registrations, over 700 payments and providing more than 20 local managers of local sections and the Organising Committee of The Crete Trip 2017 with the IT tools to manage the event. 


The code was written on the go, so it contains a lot of patches that had to be thought of and integrated on the spot, that will be refactored with the next release.

I am aware of various keys for services, such as google recaptcha, being displayed in plaintext on the repo and some bad practices regarding storing data that were discovered after the implementation of parts of the program. These will all be patched/changed in the next release.
